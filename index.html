    <h2><i class="fas fa-user"></i> About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        Iâ€™m passionate about the hospitality and tourism industry, and Iâ€™m excited to apply for the
        <strong>Hospitality &amp; Tourism Management programme at Nanyang Polytechnic</strong>. Iâ€™m
        particularly interested in modules like <em>Fundamentals of the Hospitality Environment</em>,
        where I can deepen my understanding of service, operations, and guest experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        From what Iâ€™ve learned, the NYP programme doesnâ€™t just teach theory â€” it gives students
        real-world exposure to business management and marketing skills, which are critical in this
        fast-moving industry. I believe this hands-on approach will help me build both confidence and
        practical expertise.
      </p>
      <p>
        While my education at ITE College East provided a strong foundation, Iâ€™m ready to take the next
        step in a more focused environment. Even though my background includes some tech-related
        studies, I see strong links between technology and business â€” for example, how digital tools
        help hospitality brands grow, promote campaigns online, and deliver seamless guest
        experiences.

      <h3>Alphaeus @ Kyndryl</h3>
      <p class="position">Information Technology Technician</p>
      <p class="description">
        As part of my internship, I am currently working at <strong>Alphaeus under Kyndryl</strong> as
        an IT Technician. In this role, Iâ€™ve applied knowledge from modules such as
        <em>Computer Maintenance</em> and <em>System Hardening</em>.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        I assist users in the <strong>healthcare sector</strong> with technical issues such as
        <span class="highlight">account unlocks</span>, <span class="highlight">password resets</span>,
        and <span class="highlight">VPN troubleshooting</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        This experience has taught me to adapt quickly and stay professional in high-pressure
        situations. Iâ€™ve become more confident in my technical skills with guidance from my mentors
        and supervisors.

    <h2><i class="fas fa-user-check"></i> Reflection</h2>
    <div class="reflection-text">
      <p>
        One of my key strengths is the ability to effectively balance academic responsibilities with
        part-time work, even in demanding situations. While currently undertaking an internship, I
        also hold a part-time job on weekendsâ€”demonstrating my commitment, discipline, and ability to
        manage my time well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although my part-time role is not directly related to the IT or business field, it has played a
        significant role in sharpening my organisational skills and work ethicâ€”qualities that are
        essential in both the tech and business sectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, one area I continue to work on is maintaining a sustainable work-life balance.
        Juggling multiple commitments has taught me the importance of prioritisation, setting
        boundaries, and knowing when to seek supportâ€”valuable lessons that I will carry forward in my
        academic and professional journey.
