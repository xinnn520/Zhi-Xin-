    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        I am passionate about the hospitality and tourism industry and excited to apply for the
        <strong>Hospitality &amp; Tourism Management programme at Nanyang Polytechnic</strong>. I look
        forward to deepening my knowledge in modules like <em>Fundamentals of the Hospitality Environment</em>,
        which will enhance my understanding of service, operations, and guest experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The NYP programme stands out for its practical approach, giving students opportunities to
        experience business management and marketing first-handâ€”skills essential to thrive in this
        dynamic field.
      </p>
      <p>
        While my foundation in technology from ITE College East has been strong, I am eager to
        integrate this with business studies, recognizing how technology and hospitality intertwineâ€”
        for example, through digital marketing and seamless guest services.

      <p>
        One of my strengths lies in balancing academic studies with part-time work effectively, even when faced with demanding schedules. Alongside my internship, I work part-time on weekends, honing discipline and time management skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although my part-time role is outside the IT and business sectors, it has cultivated strong organizational skills and a solid work ethic, both vital for success.
      </p>
      <p>
        A continuous goal for me is to maintain a healthy work-life balance, learning prioritization, setting boundaries, and seeking support when neededâ€”lessons I will carry into my future endeavors.
