    <h3>Alphaeus @ Kyndryl</h3>
    <p class="position">Information Technology Technician</p>
    <p class="description">
      As part of my internship, I am currently working at <strong>Alphaeus under Kyndryl</strong> as an IT Technician. In this role, Iâ€™ve applied knowledge from modules such as <em>Computer Maintenance</em> and <em>System Hardening</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      I assist users in the <strong>healthcare sector</strong> with technical issues such as <span class="highlight">account unlocks</span>, <span class="highlight">password resets</span>, and <span class="highlight">VPN troubleshooting</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      This experience has taught me to adapt quickly and stay professional in high-pressure situations. Iâ€™ve become more confident in my technical skills with guidance from my mentors and supervisors.

  <div class="reflection-text">
    <p>
      One of my key strengths is the ability to effectively balance academic responsibilities with part-time work, even in demanding situations. While currently undertaking an internship, I also hold a part-time job on weekendsâ€”demonstrating my commitment, discipline, and ability to manage my time well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although my part-time role is not directly related to the IT or business field, it has played a significant role in sharpening my organisational skills and work ethicâ€”qualities that are essential in both the tech and business sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, one area I continue to work on is maintaining a sustainable work-life balance. Juggling multiple commitments has taught me the importance of prioritisation, setting boundaries, and knowing when to seek supportâ€”valuable lessons that I will carry forward in my academic and professional journey.

<section class="about-me">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-user"></i> About Me</h2>
  <div class="about-text">
    <p>
      I am passionate about building a career in the hospitality and tourism industry, and I am excited to apply for the <strong>Hospitality &amp; Tourism Management programme at Nanyang Polytechnic</strong>. I am particularly drawn to modules such as <em>Fundamentals of the Hospitality Environment</em>, which will deepen my understanding of industry operations and customer engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through my research, I discovered that the NYP programme offers valuable hands-on experiences â€” including opportunities to learn how to manage hospitality businesses and develop marketing strategies that are vital to the industry. These experiences will equip me with both the practical knowledge and leadership mindset required to thrive in this fast-paced sector.
    </p>
    <p>
      My time at ITE College East has provided a strong foundation, but I am eager to further my studies in a more specialised and immersive environment. While my background is in technology, I see strong connections between tech and business â€” especially in areas such as online branding, digital marketing, and operational efficiency. Technology is essential to helping businesses grow, connect with customers, and stay competitive in a digital world.
