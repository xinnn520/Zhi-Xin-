      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am deeply passionate about the hospitality and tourism sector and am excited to apply for the <strong>Hospitality & Tourism Management programme at Nanyang Polytechnic</strong>. Through this programme, I aim to gain deeper insights into key areas such as <em>Fundamentals of the Hospitality Environment</em>, which will equip me to deliver exceptional service and operational excellence.</p>
      <p>What excites me most about NYP is its practical, hands-on approach, allowing students to develop real-world skills in business management and marketingâ€”both crucial to thrive in todayâ€™s fast-evolving hospitality industry.</p>
      <p>While my current studies at ITE College East have provided a solid foundation in technology, I am eager to expand my knowledge and combine it with business skills. I recognize the vital role technology plays in hospitalityâ€”from digital marketing to enhancing guest experiences through innovative solutions.</p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>A key strength of mine is effectively balancing academic pursuits with part-time work, even during busy periods. Alongside my internship, I maintain a weekend part-time job, which has sharpened my discipline and time management.</p>
      <p>Although unrelated directly to IT or business, this role has been instrumental in developing my organizational skills and work ethicâ€”traits essential to success in any field.</p>
      <p>I continue to focus on achieving a sustainable work-life balance by prioritizing tasks, setting clear boundaries, and seeking support when neededâ€”practices I am confident will serve me well moving forward.</p>
