    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        I am deeply passionate about the hospitality and tourism sector and am excited to apply for the
        <strong>Hospitality &amp; Tourism Management programme at Nanyang Polytechnic</strong>. Through this programme, I aim to gain deeper insights into key areas such as
        <em>Fundamentals of the Hospitality Environment</em>, which will equip me to deliver exceptional service and operational excellence.
      </p>
      <p>
        What excites me most about NYP is its practical, hands-on approach, allowing students to develop real-world skills in business management and marketingâ€”both crucial to thrive in todayâ€™s fast-evolving hospitality industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        While my current studies at ITE College East have provided a solid foundation in technology, I am eager to expand my knowledge and combine it with business skills. I recognize the vital role technology plays in hospitalityâ€”from digital marketing to enhancing guest experiences through innovative solutions.

      <p class="position">Information Technology Technician</p>
      <p class="description">
        Currently interning as an IT Technician at <strong>Alphaeus under Kyndryl</strong>, where I apply concepts from

      <p>
        A key strength of mine is effectively balancing academic pursuits with part-time work, even during busy periods. Alongside my internship, I maintain a weekend part-time job, which has sharpened my discipline and time management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although unrelated directly to IT or business, this role has been instrumental in developing my organizational skills and work ethicâ€”traits essential to success in any field.
      </p>
      <p>
        I continue to focus on achieving a sustainable work-life balance by prioritizing tasks, setting clear boundaries, and seeking support when neededâ€”practices I am confident will serve me well moving forward.
